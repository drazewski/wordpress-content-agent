## 🚀 Start Here

This repository helps AI agents such as Codex, GitHub Copilot, Claude, Gemini, or similar tools create structured article drafts.

The first action in a fresh copy of this repository is always onboarding.

`project-context.md` is intentionally not included. It is created by onboarding for a specific site, author, brand, publication, or editorial team.

> Onboarding is intentionally short. It creates a first usable `project-context.md`, and you can manually edit that file at any time later.

## 🧭 Quick Start

Use one of these entry points:

```text
codex "Start onboarding for this repository"
```

```text
codex "$onboarding"
```

In GitHub Copilot:

```text
Run the onboarding workflow for this repository.
```

Or copy the ready prompt from:

```text
prompts/start-onboarding.md
```

The agent should:

1. Read `README.md`.
2. Read `AGENTS.md`.
3. Read `.agents/skills/onboarding/SKILL.md`.
4. Tell the user that `project-context.md` can be edited manually later.
5. Ask only short onboarding questions, one at a time, including article length, heading preference, source link preference, and whether the user wants the optional WordPress draft step after the Markdown file is created.
6. Create `project-context.md`.
7. Stop before article writing or publishing.

## ✏️ You Can Edit Context Later

The onboarding result is not final or locked. It is only a starting profile for the agent.

After onboarding, you can open `project-context.md` and change anything manually:

- project description,
- audience,
- tone,
- source rules,
- categories and tags,
- publishing target,
- notes about what to avoid,
- examples of articles to follow.

You do not need to get everything right during onboarding.

## 📝 Create An Article

After onboarding:

1. Create one topic folder in `source/`.
   - Example: `source/mikroplastik-w-rzekach/`
2. Add all source materials for one article to that folder.
   - PDFs, reports, notes, links, briefs, text files, and reference material are all acceptable.
3. Ask the agent to create the article, or copy:

```text
prompts/create-article.md
```

Finished drafts should be written to:

```text
articles/<topic>.md
```

## ⚙️ Agent Workflow

Agents should use the repository in this order:

1. `onboarding` - create or refresh `project-context.md`.
2. `source-analysis` - analyze PDFs, reports, local notes, and other source documents.
3. `web-research` - use external research only when allowed or requested.
4. `editorial-style` - draft the article in the configured editorial style.
5. `seo` - refine title, slug, excerpt, and meta description.
6. `taxonomy` - choose category and tags.
7. `editorial-review` - optional review before handoff or publishing.
8. `markdown-export` - required default file output to Markdown or MDX.
9. `social-teaser` - optional teaser and social copy.
10. `wordpress-publish` - optional WordPress draft creation only when explicitly requested.

## 🧩 Optional WordPress Integration

The core workflow is CMS-neutral. Markdown is always the primary output format, while WordPress is treated as an optional publishing target.

By default, the workflow operates in Markdown-only mode. However, agents can also create or update WordPress drafts.

Users can decide whether WordPress integration should be enabled during onboarding or later by modifying the `project-context.md` file.

To enable WordPress draft creation:

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure the WordPress API credentials
3. Ask the agent to create or update a WordPress draft after generating the Markdown article

All WordPress posts are created with `draft` status by default.
